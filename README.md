# Password-Generator
Password Generator

## Description and Requirements

This week's Challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
<!-- Done -->

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
<!-- Done -->

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
<!-- Done -->

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
<!-- Done -->

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
<!-- Done -->

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
<!-- Done -->

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
<!-- The functions are working, but can't seem to get anything to display in the password box given by the cloned code, used an alert to display instead. -->


```
